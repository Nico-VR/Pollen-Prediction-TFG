    "- ```OFFSET_DAYS```.  The distance between the first January value of ```START_YEAR``` and the first date that will have ```HORIZON_SIZE``` prediction steps. For example, ```OFFSET_DAYS=-5``` means we start from December 25th of the year prior to ```START_YEAR```, not from the first day of January to have ```HORIZON_SIZE``` predictions.\n",
